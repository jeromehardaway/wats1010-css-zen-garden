With so many wonderful design concepts available on css zen garden, I often
found myself getting pulled in multiple directions. Based on what I have learned
through this week from all the numerous resources provided, I ultimately decided
to just keep my design with a few basic ideas in mind - keeping a consistent layout throughout all pages, keeping it as simple as possible, and maintaining
a layout design that users would typically expect when visiting a webpage.

I chose to keep the header and footer information at the top and bottom of the page, because that's where visitors would typically expect to find them that information. Just below the header content I determined that it would be appropriate to place a bread trail to inform users what area of the site they were on, just in case they were navigating through a search engine and didn't end up on the homepage.

I kept the main content on the left side of the page, although I could have switched the location to be on the right where the aside content is positioned. For pages that have an extensive navigation menu I would position in a column along the left side, but because this site has minimal content I found that it would be unnecessary, and to just keep this simple approach to help visitors identify the content that they are search for immediately.
